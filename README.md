## Project Cipher  
A comprehensive tool for encrypting, decrypting, and puzzle solving alike! There are tools for encrypting and decrypting messages with a variety of ciphers. There will also be tools primarily for helping puzzle solvers, especially in relation to aristocrat-related cryptograms. The goal is to create a tool with a variety of cipher techniques and to facilitate puzzle solvers out there!  
  
**Current Ciphers Implemented:**    
1. Caesar Cipher (Done) - Allows for Encryption, Manual Decryption, Automatic Decryption (in file - example file here: *Src/TestCases/Caesar_Cipher*)
2. Aristocrat Helper (Work-In-Progress) - Puzzle Visualizer, Manual Solver, Frequency Tables Complete; Automated Guessing WIP - Testing Version Complete; Auto-Answer Checker coming soon!
3. Baconian Solver (Work-In-Progress) - Puzzle Visualizer + Manual Solver WIP
4. XOR Cipher (Work-In-Progress)
5. Image-Based Pigpen Cipher (Coming Soon!)
6. Vignere Cipher (Coming Soon!)
